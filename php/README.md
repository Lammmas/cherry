I used my own Auth RPC service to fake logins, although it would be easy enough to roll my own OAuth handler and use that to trigger the 'login bonus'. However, since I've spent enough time trying to get this framework to work, I'm not going to delve into the OAuth customization now. If I had a couple of more days, I'd do it properly :)
