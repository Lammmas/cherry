# PHP
Using your best OO PHP code, with or without a MVC framework, implement a small application which would allow to simulate the mechanisms associated with bonuses and triggers (actions that associate a bonus with a player).

Your web application should allow creating each one of the different entities (Players, Bonuses, Wallets) and establish associations.

Once the entities are created (players and bonuses were added), implement a form which facilitates a simulation where a player can make deposits or logins and get bonuses awarded to him (for example, if there is an on deposit bonus created and the player makes a deposit, the reward amount should be given to the player).

As well, this page should allow the player to play some spins (please assume that a player randomly wins or loses 10 EUR per spin).

A balance panel should show the different wallets’ balances being updated – please don’t forget to consider the wagering requirements and see when the Bonus money should be converted to Real money.

# Angular 2

For this, you need to build a games lobby interface, which needs to have these
functionalities:
 - Game categories navigation
 - Games list
 - Games search
 
For this assessment you need to use our own staging API to fetch the game categories and games.
 
The game lobby page should be fully functional with a convincing header and footer if it makes sense in your design. The user must be able to navigate between categories, and the game pages should be accessible (the actual game doesn’t need to work; you can just put a game placeholder).

All of this needs to be made using Angular 2 without any other framework dependency at all, like jQuery. Also, a CSS framework must be used like Twitter Bootstrap or others.

As a suggestion, for your own sake, you should probably research/use yeoman. It will get you started within minutes, and import all of the libraries and tools needed for this assessment.

Also, you don’t need to worry about browser compatibility. That’s not what we want to evaluate. Therefore, it would be good if you tell us which browser you used for development when you deliver the project.
